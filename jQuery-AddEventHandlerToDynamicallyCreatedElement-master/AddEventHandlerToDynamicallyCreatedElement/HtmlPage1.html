<!--
     In this code the click event handler is attached to the parent element (ul). 
    Even if you have 500 list items, there is only one click event handler in memory.

    1. When you click on a list item (li), the event gets bubbled up to its parent (ul) as the list item (li) does not have an event handler
    2. The bubbled event is handled by the the parent (ul) element, as it has a click event handler.
    3. When a new list item is added dynamicaly, you don't have to add the click event handler to it.
    Since the newly created list item (li) is added to the same parent element (ul),
    the click event of this list item also gets bubbled upto the same parent and will be handled by it.
